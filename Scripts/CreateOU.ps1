.SYNOPSIS
    Establishes the Organizational Unit (OU) structure and organizes AD objects.

.DESCRIPTION
    Creates a hierarchical OU structure under a root domain OU. 
    OUs created: Computers, Users, Groups, and Admins (under Users).
    Automatically relocates newly created users and groups from default containers to the new structure.
    Also selects random members from 'IT Department' to elevate to Domain Admins for the scenario.
